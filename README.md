This is project allows streamers to play music on spotify and pass it to their viewers using a room which code is provided to the streamer.
The project is composed of a discord bot which detects what music the streamer is playing through their stuatus and then notifies the website which will update the music
coresponding to each streamer in their "room" so viwers would be able to put the stream on one tab and listen to the music of the streamer from the other.
